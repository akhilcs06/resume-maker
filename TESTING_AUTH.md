# Authentication Testing Guide

This guide will help you test all the Clerk authentication features we've implemented.

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Environment Setup Test
First, make sure your environment is configured correctly:

```bash
# Check if the server is running
npm run dev
```

The server should start on `http://localhost:5173`

### 2. Authentication Flow Test

#### Without Authentication:
1. **Open `http://localhost:5173`** 
2. **Expected**: You should see a beautiful landing page with:
   - "Welcome to Resume Maker" message
   - Sign In and Get Started buttons
   - Feature list (AI-powered, templates, etc.)

#### With Authentication:
1. **Click "Get Started" or "Sign In"**
2. **Expected**: Clerk modal should open
3. **Sign up** with a new account or **sign in** with existing
4. **Expected**: After authentication, you should be redirected to the dashboard

### 3. Dashboard Features Test

Once signed in, verify these features work:

#### Header Component:
- ‚úÖ Shows "Welcome, [FirstName]!" message
- ‚úÖ Displays user avatar/profile image
- ‚úÖ UserButton component from Clerk (click to see profile options)

#### ProfileWidget:
- ‚úÖ Shows user's name and email
- ‚úÖ Displays profile image or generated avatar
- ‚úÖ Shows account status and stats

#### Authentication Example Component:
- ‚úÖ Displays user ID, email, and first name
- ‚úÖ "Test Auth Headers" button - should get JWT token
- ‚úÖ "Test API Call" button - will fail (expected, no backend yet)
- ‚úÖ "Test Save Resume" button - will fail (expected, no backend yet)

### 4. Route Protection Test

1. **Sign out** using the UserButton in header
2. **Try to access** `http://localhost:5173` directly
3. **Expected**: Should redirect to landing page, not dashboard

### 5. User Data Integration Test

1. **Check resume form**:
   - Name field should be pre-filled with your Clerk name
   - Email field should be pre-filled with your Clerk email

2. **Check welcome messages**:
   - Header should show "Welcome, [YourFirstName]!"
   - Dashboard should show personalized greeting

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Missing Publishable Key" Error
```bash
# Make sure .env.local exists and contains:
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
```

### Authentication Modal Not Opening
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Clerk publishable key is correct
- Check that domain is allowed in Clerk dashboard

### User Data Not Showing
- Check that you're signed in
- Verify browser console for any hook errors
- Make sure component is wrapped in ClerkProvider

### Styling Issues
- Check for CSS conflicts
- Verify styled-components is working
- Check browser dev tools for styling errors

## üìù Expected Behavior Summary

| Component | Unauthenticated | Authenticated |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| App.tsx | Shows Landing | Shows Dashboard |
| Header | Sign In button | User profile + UserButton |
| ProtectedRoute | Landing page | Passes through to children |
| Dashboard | Not accessible | Full functionality |
| ProfileWidget | Not shown | Shows user data |
| AuthExample | "Please sign in" | Interactive testing buttons |

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once authentication is working:

1. **Set up backend API** with Supabase
2. **Implement resume saving** functionality  
3. **Add more templates** and customization options
4. **Deploy to production** with environment variables
